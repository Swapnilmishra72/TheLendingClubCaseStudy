## General Information
The credit facility is an integral part of the finance industry. Lending institutions need to scrutinize the credit worthiness and risk profile of borrowers in order to make informed lending decisions. The purpose of this article is to analyze the loan database and identify patterns, trends and insights that can help improve the loan lending process.

## Data
The data used in this case study consists of historical credit information, including attributes such as borrower information, credit profile, credit score, operating status, income, loan amount, interest rate, and including credit status

## Objective:

1. Data Exploration: Conduct detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, transformation, and classification of the data set.
